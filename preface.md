### Preface

The main part of the preface still needs to be done. I just wanted to add this conventions section.

##### Conventions.

Much of the interaction you will have with PredictionIO is you typing commands in a terminal window. 

![Alt text](http://guidetodatamining.com/markdownPics/pterminal.png)

If you are not fluent in using the command line, in typed `pwd`, which stands for print working directory and the system printed my current directory `/Users/raz`. Next I changed my curent directory to `tmp` by typing `cd tmp`. Finally, I listed the contents of that directory by typing `ls`. Throughout this book, this terminal interaction will be indicated by in a separate block of text and the commands we type in are prefaced by `~$`. So the above interaction would be indicated by:

```

~$ pwd
/Users/raz
~$ cd tmp
~$ ls
f.zip

```

Any commands and other code related phrases within running text are indicated as shown here for `/Users/tmp` and `cd tmp`.

Periodically, I will ask you, the reader, a question. Often these will be set off from the main text as shown:
